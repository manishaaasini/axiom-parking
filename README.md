This is a project which tells us wheather the parking slot is empty or not we use of a stimulator-"CISCO PACKET TRACER".

We propose a design and development of a natural smart parking system consisting of an on-site
deployment of an IoT module that is used to monitor and signalize the state of vacancy of each
single parking space. An efficient and smart way to automate the management of the parking
system that allocates an efficient parking space using internet of things technology. The IoT
provides wireless access to the system and the user can keep track of the availability of the
parking area. With an increase in the population of vehicles in metropolitan cities, road
congestion is a major problem that is being faced. The aim of this paper is to resolve this issue.
The user usually wastes his time and efforts in search of the availability of free space in a
specified parking area. The parking information is sent to the user via notification. Thus, the
waiting time for the user in search of parking space is minimised.

Cisco Packet Tracer is Cisco's simulation software. It can be used to create complicated network
typologies and test and simulate abstract networking concepts. It acts as a playground for you to
explore networking and the experience is very close to what you see in computer networks.


SCOPE:
Nowadays parking is very important and hence it is necessary for every vehicle owner to park
his or her car in a secure designated parking slot available. To escalate this particular system
various parking owners have integrated themselves with sophisticated parking control systems,
which are high tech and offer full-fledged parking services.
Some of the parking areas are lacking such facilities and hence fail all the security norms
necessary to park a vehicle. By looking such a huge concern, it is highly required that each
parking area should be well equipped with high tech parking control systems, that nevertheless
lasts the best.These innovative parking control systems not only make a bright choice but also allow you to
pay the right price without getting any worry.

Our main aim is to provide a smart city by providing information about availability of slots in
our own mobile. Some of the parking areas are lacking such facilities and hence fail all the
security norms necessary to park a vehicle.
